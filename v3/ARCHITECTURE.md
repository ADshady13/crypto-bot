# CryptoBot V4 — LLM Challenger Bot Architecture (Stub)

## Phase 5 Forward Looking Architecture

This directory is reserved for the `Challenger Bot`.

The V3 XGBoost deterministic bot (in `v2/`) runs heavily optimized numerical models. The V4 Challenger Bot will operate in parallel using the exact same data feed, but trade purely on **LLM-Synthesized Reasoning** and Agentic heuristics.

### Objective
To run an A/B test between pure mathematical derivatives machine learning (XGBoost) vs pure semantic reasoning (Local LLMs / Claude).

*(To be built out in Phase 5...)*
